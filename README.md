# MechaKaku

No one can stand before it.


## TODO
- [X] respond to username mentions
- [X] learn about the event types so you can write methods for them
- [X] regular messages seem to be read fine; how to get /me commands?
- [X] respond to bang! commands
- [X] get list of bang! commands to support
- [ ] figure out a good deployment strategy (Heroku? Might not be the best choice here)
- [ ] logging? (depends partially on deployment strat)
- [ ] the on_pubmsg username parsing feels a little rough...make sure that's the right way to do it
- [ ] deal with Twitch's rate limiting, and make sure we don't spam

### Commands to respond to
- [X] !help (show some of the commands available (but some are surprises and not in this list))
- [ ] !pb (list PB for either current game or all of kaku's games)
- [ ] !wr (list WR for either current game or all of kaku's games)
- [ ] !tuturu (???)
- [ ] !sudoku (???)
- [ ] !emotes (list kaku's emotes)
- [X] !motivate (link that NEVAH GIVE UP video)
- [ ] get suggestions from the weebs for other ideas here

### Other behaviors
- [X] auto-copypasta (when someone posts msg over X chars long (figure out X) repost Zooobz style)
- [X] :j response when someone starts a :j train
- [ ] huh? response when someone starts a huh? train
- [ ] links to kaku-related images (e.g. that "Lewd" photoshop)
- [ ] links to kaku-related audio (e.g. "the east and the wessssst")
- [ ] be mean to some users (e.g. ignore or disobey commands from them)

### Maybe?
- [ ] random post periodically if chat is ded
- [ ] store chat log on disk like an IRC bouncer
