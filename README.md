No one can stand before it.


## TODO
- [ ] respond to username mentions
- [ ] learn about the event types so you can write methods for them
- [ ] regular messages seem to be read fine; how to get /me commands?
- [ ] respond to bang! commands
- [ ] get list of bang! commands to support
- [ ] figure out a good deployment strategy (Heroku? Might not be the best choice here)
- [ ] logging? (depends partially on deployment strat)
- [ ] the on_pubmsg username parsing feels a little rough...make sure that's the right way to do it

### Commands to respond to
- [ ] !tuturu

### Other behaviors
- [ ] auto-copypasta (when someone posts msg over X chars long (figure out X) repost Zooobz style)
